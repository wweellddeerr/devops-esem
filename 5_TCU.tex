In this section we detail an real experience on DevOps adoption where we could
demonstrate the practical application of the model proposed above.

\subsection{Context}

The TCU is responsible for the accounting, financial, budget, performance, and property
oversight of federal institutions and entities of the country. Currently, there are 2500
professionals working at the TCU, of which approximately 300 work directly on either
software development or operations. The source code repository at the TCU hosts,
more than 200 software project, totaling over 4 million lines of code.

For many years, the TCU software development process was marked by a strong call
for standardization of procedures. This approach favored the specialization of
activities, causing segregation of development and operations teams in a rigid
silo structure. Work on this structure revolved around bureaucratic
communication and well-defined service level agreements - SLAs. Communication
between teams occurred basically through the use of a corporate service-desk tool.
The SLAs provided maximum deadlines for the operations team to perform the
procedures requested by the development team through the service-desk. The
procedures include provisioning of infrastructure and database servers for
development, testing, staging and production environments, requesting access
to server logs, and the most controversial of all: deployment of new versions
of applications. The deployment involved a long chain of a week-long process,
whose complex chaining of responsibilities often ran out of schedule, causing
months of delays in software deliveries.

In addition to delays in software deliveries, the silo structure caused a
devastating blaming game between the teams. If there were delays in delivery
or errors in some functionality, the focus was not on solving the problem, but
on pointing out which team was the culprit.

In search of solutions to these problems, and knowing the alleged benefits of
the approach, the TCU included the development of the DevOps approach among the
objective of its IT area. The first attempt by the technical teams to reach the
goal was to seek consulting firms whose proposed solutions invariably involved
implanting specific DevOps tools. These DevOps tools were typically related to
automate some aspect of the process and, naturally, the teams turned their
attentions to establish clear and separated responsibilities to each aspect of
the tools. Obviously, these DevOps tools only changed the points of conflict.
In this context, our research was developed and, after that, we applied our
model aiming to increase the DevOps level at TCU. In this section we described
this experience.

\subsection{Applying The Model}

Before the application of our model, the TCU had produced some w.r.t deployment
automation results and the focus was being directed to the tooling issue. Considering this
incomplete perspective of DevOps, the conflicts between development and operations
teams continued. That is, the mere advance in implanting ``DevOps tools'' simply
changed the points of conflict, but they persisted.

After the presentation of our  model in a series of lectures, development and
operations teams changed their focus to build a \cc. This
change was only possible due to the engagement and sponsorship of the IT
managers. Looking to the concepts within the \cc category, the first practical
action at the TCU was to facilitate communication between teams. The use of tickets
was then abolished. The problems had to be solved in a collaborative way, preferably
face to face.
Looking to enablers, the TCU is applying \cat{sharing and transparency} concepts.
The role of internal tech talks and committees to disseminate that collaboration
culture and related concepts is being reinforced.
When a new infrastructure had to be provided and configured, the current guideline is
that there must be a kind of \emph{pair programming} between developers and infrastructure
members. All application related tasks must be executed in a collaborative
way. Naturally, the professionals noticed that automation would facilitate the
operationalization of that collaboration. For this reason, the infrastructure provisioning
and management was automated.

The TCU also uses continuous measurement and quality assurance concepts as
enablers of its DevOps adoption. The applications started to be continuously
tested and measured. The tests were automated and included in the pipelines.
Verification of test coverage and quality code also became part of the pipeline.
This increased the confidence between teams. The TCU started
to explore the potential of DevOps tools, like recovery automation, zero
down-time, and auto scaling. The deployment has also been automated.
It is important to note that, before DevOps, deployment activities were historically a controversial point at the TCU.
Several conflicts occurred over time. Rigid procedures were created to try to
avoid problems. These ``rigid procedures'' often led to periods of months
without any software delivery. The more collaborative scenario, with a strong appeal in automation and quality,
created by following an appropriate path in adopting DevOps, enabled the deployment activities to become
a lightweight task at the TCU. Continuous deployment became a reality and, currently, several deployments
occur as regular activities of the development teams at the TCU.

Since the TCU is a government institution, some advances in DevOps adoption still comes up
against regulatory issues. For example, there are internal regulations that
establish that only the operations sector is responsible for issues related to
application infrastructure, contrasting with shared responsibilities that are
part of the \cc. Nevertheless, our model enabled the TCU to adopt DevOps in a more
sustainable way. Knowing the role
of each DevOps element in the adoption was fundamental for the TCU to avoid points
of failure and to build a collaborative environment that supports the
exploration of DevOps benefits.

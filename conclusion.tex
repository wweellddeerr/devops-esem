\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, grounded in data collected from successfully DevOps adoption
experiences, we present a theory on DevOps adoption, a model of how to adopt
DevOps according with this theory and a case where this model has been tested
in practice.

We found that the DevOps adoption involves a very specific relationship between
7 key categories: agility, automation, \cc, \cat{continuous
measurement}, \cat{quality assurance}, \cat{resilience}, \cat{sharing and transparency}.
The core category of DevOps adoption is the \cc. Some of the
identified categories (i.e., automation, sharing and transparency) only exist
to propitiate the foundation of a \cc. Other categories
(i.e., agility and resilience) are expected consequences of this formation.
Finally, two other categories (i.e., continuous measurement and quality
assurance) work as both foundations and consequences. We call the foundations
categories as ``DevOps enablers'', and the consequences categories as ``DevOps outcomes''.

Crucially, we propose that this way of guidance simplify the understanding of the
complex set of elements that are part of DevOps adoption, enabling it to be
more direct and with lower risk of focusing on wrong things.

GT studies typically do not claim to be definitive, the resulting theory should
be modifiable in other contexts \cite{}. What this means is that we do not claim
this theory to be absolute or final. We welcome extensions to the theory based
on unseen aspects or finer details of the present categories or potential discovery
of new dimensions from future studies. Future work can focus on investigate contexts
where DevOps adoption was not well succeeded, aim to validate if our model could be
relevant in this scenario.

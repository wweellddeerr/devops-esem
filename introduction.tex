\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

DevOps is a a set of practices and cultural values that has emerged in the
software development industry. Even before
the existence of the term --- a mix of ``development'' and ``operations''
words~\cite{httermann2012devops} --- companies like Flickr~\cite{flickr}
had already pointed out the need to break the existing separation between
the operations and software development teams. Since then, the term
has appeared without clear delimitation and gained strength and interest
in companies that perceived the benefits of applying agile practices in
\emph{operation tasks}.
DevOps claimed benefits include increased organizational IT
performance and productivity, cost reduction in software lifecycle, improvement
in operational efficacy and efficiency, better quality of software products and
greater business alignment between development and operations
teams~\cite{characterizing_devops_sbes_2016,state_of_devops,DevOps_Adoption_Benefits_and_Challenges}.
However, the adoption of DevOps is still a challenging task, because there is a
plethora of information, practices, and tools related to DevOps, but it is still unclear
how one could leverage such rich, yet scattered, information in an organized and
structured way in order to properly adopt DevOps.

Existing research works have proposed a
number of DevOps characterizations, for instance, as a set of concepts with
related
practices~\cite{cooperation_dev_ops_esem_2014,devops_a_definition_xp_15,dimensions_of_devops_xp_15,extending_dimensions_icsea_16,characterizing_devops_sbes_2016,qualitative_devops_journalsw_17}. Although some
of these studies leverage qualitative approaches to gather practitioners perception (for instance,
conducting interviews with them), they focus on characterizing DevOps,
instead of providing recommendations to assist on DevOps adoption. Consequently,
our {\bf research problem} is that the obtained DevOps characterizations allow a
comprehensive understanding of the elements that constitute DevOps, but do not
provide detailed guidance to support newcomers interested in adopting DevOps practices.
As a consequence, many practical and timely questions still remain open, for
instance: (1) Is there any recommended path to adopt DevOps? (2) Since
DevOps is composed by multiple elements~\cite{dimensions_of_devops_xp_15}, do
these elements have the same relevance, when adopting DevOps?
(3) What is the role played by elements such as measurement, sharing, and automation
in a DevOps adoption? To provide answers to these questions, we need a holistic
understanding of the paths followed in successful DevOps adoptions.

In this paper, we present a model based on the perceptions of practitioners from
15 companies across five countries that successfully adopted DevOps. The model
was constructed based on a classic Grounded Theory (GT) approach,
and make clear that practitioners interested in adoption DevOps should focus on building a
\cc, which prevents common pitfalls related to focusing on tooling or automation.
We instantiated our model in the Brazilian Federal Court of
Accounts (hereafter TCU), a Brazilian Federal Government institution. TCU was
bogged down in implanting specific DevOps tools, repeating the same non-DevOps
problems, with conflicts between development and operations teams about how to
divide the responsibilities related to different facets in the intersection
between software development and software provisioning. When instantiated,
our model helped TCU to change its focus to improve the collaboration between teams, and to use the tooling
to support (rather than being the goal of) the entire process.
The main contributions of this paper are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A model, based on the classic Grounded Theory approach, that could support practitioners interested in adopting DevOps,
      based on evidence acquired from their industry peers;
\item An instantiation of this model in a real world, non-trivial context. TCU is different from the typical \emph{tech companies}
that have successfully reported the adoption of DevOps, though the use of our model there have brought several benefits and
now DevOps practices have been disseminated at TCU.
\end{itemize}

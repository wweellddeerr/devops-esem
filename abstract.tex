\begin{abstract}
  DevOps is a set of practices that has gained increasing
  interest in the industry and that aims to reduce the
  barriers between the development and {\color{red}production}
  teams. Due to its increasing interest and controversial
  definitions, existing research works have characterize DevOps
  as a set of concepts and related practices. However, little
  is known about how practitioners understand successfull
  paths for DevOps adoption \gnote{because.... explain why}.
  Based on a Grounded Theory study of 15 well succeeded DevOps
  adoptions in companies across five countries, we
  present a model to improve both the understanding and guidance
  of DevOps adoption. The model increments the existing view of
  DevOps by explanning the role and motivation of each
  element (and their relationship) in the DevOps adoption process.
  We have been using this model to increase the maturity level
  on DevOps adoption in the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts,
  a company of Brazilian Federal Government.

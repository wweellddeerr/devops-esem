\begin{abstract}
DevOps is a term that has emerged in the industry. Using predominantly
literature reviews, academic studies have sought to characterize it as a set
of concepts with related practices. This view of DevOps does not provides clear
guidance to companies that want to adopt DevOps, \gnote{because.... explain why}
. Since DevOps is a term coined in the software industry, it seems
to be appropriate to investigate DevOps adoption with
more clear guidance to new practitioners. Based on a Grounded Theory study of
15 well succeeded DevOps adoptions in companies across five countries, we
present a model to improve the understanding and guidance of DevOps adoption.
The model increments the existing view of DevOps by explanning the role
and motivation of each element (and their relationship) in the DevOps
adoption process. The model was applied in the DevOps adoption of
Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts, a company of Brazilian Federal Government.

\begin{abstract}
  DevOps is a set of practices that has gained increasing
  attention in the industry and that aims to reduce the
  barriers between the development and production
  teams. Due to its increasing interest and imprecise
  definitions, existing research works have tried to
  characterize DevOps as a set of concepts and related practices.
  However, little is known about the practitioners understand
  about the successful paths for DevOps adoption, which might
  hinder institutions to start the use DevOps practices. 
  Based on a Grounded Theory study considering 15 well succeeded DevOps
  adoptions in companies across five countries, we
  present a model to improve both the understanding and guidance
  of DevOps adoption. The model increments the existing view of
  DevOps by explaining the role and motivation of each
  element (and their relationships) in the DevOps adoption process.
  We organize this model in terms of \emph{DevOps enbler categories} and
  \emph{DevOps outcome categories}, and explain that \emph{collaboration}
  is the key aspect of Devops, contrasting with an existing wisdom that
  \emph{automating building and deployment processes} is enough to
  achieve DevOps. We have been using this model to increase the maturity level
  on DevOps adoption in the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts,
  a company of Brazilian Federal Government.
